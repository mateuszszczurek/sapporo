# Sapporo Voleyball Toruney App
- [ ] cannot add two groups with the same name (!) empty doesn't break uniqueness since it's empty
- [ ] commonize layout and logo for all pages?
- [ ] check for uniqueness - cannot create another toruney with the same name?
- [ ] prettify Submit button handler, need to prevent default, so that question mark is not added to URL
- [ ] border around forms
- [ ] extract style
- [ ] agree on sensible theme
- [ ] check that each page is rendering (in test)
- [ ] fix display name
- [ ] up to 8 groups
- [ ] handle case when we go back to create toruney app by back button (block after first creation?)
- [ ] display tourney name after toruney creation
- [ ] on "Dodaj drużynę" - try to make glyphicon with circle
- [ ] extract team as an separate object
- [ ] work out why I need inline style in Group (margin) and why bootstrap doesn't make the space by default
